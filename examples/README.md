## How to Use These Examples

### 1. Study the Context
Each example includes:
- **Initial project state** (what exists before the workflow)
- **Request classification** (how the orchestrator categorizes the work)
- **Agent selection** (which agents are chosen and why)
- **Workflow execution** (step-by-step agent chain)
- **Final output** (what gets produced)

### 2. Follow the Workflow
```bash
# Navigate to any example
cd examples/manufacturing-inventory-system/

# Review the context
cat docs/current/project-state.md

# See the workflow request
cat workflow-request.md

# Study the agent execution
cat agent-execution-log.md

# Examine the results
ls -la docs/iterations/
```

### 3. Adapt for Your Project
- Copy the relevant example structure
- Modify the context for your specific needs
- Run the workflow with your requirements
- Compare results with the example

## Example Structure

Each example follows this consistent structure:
