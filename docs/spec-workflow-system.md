# Context-Aware .NET 9 Spec Agent Workflow System

## Overview

The Context-Aware Spec Agent Workflow System revolutionizes AI-driven development by combining intelligent project state analysis with specialized .NET 9 expertise. This system transforms complex enterprise applications from conception to Azure-ready production code through context-aware AI agents that understand existing project state and eliminate unnecessary work.

**Key Innovation**: Unlike traditional linear workflows that waste tokens by regenerating everything, this system analyzes existing project context and executes only the necessary agents for each specific request type.

## Revolutionary Philosophy

### 1. **Context-Aware Intelligence**

Agents analyze existing project state from organized documentation structures before determining optimal workflow paths, eliminating the document chaos and token waste of traditional approaches.

### 2. **Request Classification & Routing**

Automatic classification of requests (NEW_PROJECT, BUG_FIX, ENHANCEMENT, REFACTOR) enables intelligent agent selection, reducing token usage by up to 70% for iterative development.

### 3. **Organized Documentation Architecture**

Structured `docs/` hierarchy with project/, architecture/, iterations/, current/, and archive/ folders maintains complete project history while preventing document chaos.

### 4. **Iterative Excellence with Token Efficiency**

The system supports continuous improvement through versioned iterations with maximum 2 retry cycles to prevent infinite token consumption while maintaining quality standards.

### 5. **.NET 9 Enterprise Specialization**

Deep expertise in Clean Architecture, Entity Framework Core, Azure deployment, and manufacturing industry requirements ensures production-ready enterprise applications.
