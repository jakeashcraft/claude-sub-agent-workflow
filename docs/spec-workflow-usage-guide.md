## Overview

The Context-Aware .NET 9 Spec Agent Workflow System revolutionizes enterprise development through intelligent project state analysis and specialized agents optimized for Clean Architecture, Entity Framework Core, and Azure deployment. This guide provides practical examples demonstrating how context awareness eliminates token waste and document chaos while delivering production-ready applications.

**Revolutionary Change**: Unlike traditional workflows that regenerate everything, this system analyzes existing project context and executes only necessary agents, reducing token usage by 70% while maintaining enterprise quality standards.

## Quick Start: Context-Aware Development

### Automatic Request Classification

```bash
# Bug Fix - Automatically uses targeted 3-agent chain instead of full 8-agent workflow
/agent-workflow "The user login is failing after Azure AD B2C integration update"
# → Classification: BUG_FIX
# → Agent Chain: orchestrator → analyst (analysis) → developer (fixes) → validator (regression)
# → Creates: iterations/v3-auth-bugfix-20241201/
# → Token Savings: ~70% compared to full workflow

# Enhancement - Intelligently determines if architecture changes needed
/agent-workflow "Add real-time inventory alerts using SignalR to existing tracking system"
# → Classification: ENHANCEMENT
# → Reads existing architecture, determines SignalR requires updates
# → Agent Chain: orchestrator → analyst → architect → developer → validator → tester
# → Creates: iterations/v4-realtime-alerts-20241201/
# → Updates: Existing docs incrementally, no regeneration

# Performance Refactoring - Focuses on code improvement without functionality changes
/agent-workflow "Optimize Entity Framework queries for the daily production reports"
# → Classification: REFACTOR
# → Agent Chain: orchestrator → architect (review) → developer (optimize) → validator (compliance)
# → Creates: iterations/v5-ef-optimization-20241201/
# → Validates: No functional changes, only performance improvements
```

### New Project Setup

```bash
# Complete .NET 9 application with Clean Architecture
/agent-workflow "Create .NET 9 Web API for manufacturing inventory management with multi-facility support, Azure deployment, and FDA compliance tracking"
# → Classification: NEW_PROJECT
# → Database-intensive keywords detected: "manufacturing", "FDA compliance"
# → Full Agent Chain: All 7 agents execute complete workflow (includes database-specialist)
# → Creates: Organized docs/ structure + Clean Architecture codebase
# → Generates: Entity Framework models, Azure deployment scripts, xUnit test suites, FDA compliance audit trails
```

```

## Performance Optimization and Token Management

### Token Usage Patterns

```markdown
**Traditional Linear Workflow Token Usage**:
Bug Fix Request: 2,500 tokens (regenerates everything)
Enhancement: 4,200 tokens (complete workflow)
Refactoring: 3,800 tokens (full documentation cycle)

**Context-Aware Token Usage**:
Bug Fix Request: 750 tokens (targeted chain) → 70% savings
Enhancement: 1,800 tokens (selective chain) → 57% savings  
Refactoring: 1,200 tokens (optimization chain) → 68% savings

**Annual Token Savings for Active Development**:
- 50 bug fixes: 87,500 tokens saved
- 20 enhancements: 48,000 tokens saved
- 15 refactoring cycles: 39,000 tokens saved
- **Total Annual Savings: 174,500 tokens**
```

### Optimization Strategies

```bash
# Enable parallel execution for large projects (when available)
/agent-workflow "Large enterprise system" --parallel=true --max-concurrent-agents=3

# Use minimal validation for rapid iteration
/agent-workflow "Quick validation of concept" --minimal-validation --quality-threshold=70

# Focus on specific quality aspects
/agent-workflow "Security-focused enhancement" --focus-quality=security --enhanced-security-validation=true
```

## Best Practices for Context-Aware Development
